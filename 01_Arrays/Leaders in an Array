A Leader is an element that is greater than all elements to its right in the array. The rightmost element is always a leader, since there are no elements to its right.


import java.util.*;

public class LeaderInArray {
    public static void printLeaders(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int maxFromRight = arr[n - 1];
        
        // Last element is always a leader
        System.out.print(maxFromRight + " ");

        // Traverse from second last to the beginning
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (arr[i] > maxFromRight) {
                maxFromRight = arr[i];
                System.out.print(maxFromRight + " ");
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2};
        System.out.print("Leaders in the array: ");
        printLeaders(arr);
    }
}
